## Features:

- The software allows users to monitor their hearing health over time and can be connected to decision-support tools to motivate them to take action in the face of hearing loss.
- Knowing that sign language is used as a communication tool for the deaf, technology should help those who are unable to understand sign language by translating it into a form that can be easily comprehended. 
- If a suitable medium of communication, such as a mobile phone, is available, this will make it easier for them to interact with others. This will assist in eliminating barriers experienced when hearing-impaired people interact with hearing people.
- The application is optimized for Android devices and is designed for real-time use with low latency.

## Scope:

The application will provide immediate alerts and maintain a log of the detected sounds.

## Non-functional Ascepts:

- Reliability
- Affordability 
- Performance
- Advanced Sensing
