Identification of Functional and Non-Functional Requirements for Library Management System

**Functional Requirements: **

1) Anyone who wishes to utilise library resources must sign up using a username and password on the library information system.
2) Any member who successfully enrolled should be able to access the LIS using the user ID and password they created.
3) Given that the book is currently on hand at the library and is not being issued by another member, any LIS member should be able to issue it.
4) The member should return the borrowed book within the stipulated time. The system should also enable the user to extend the date of his borrowing if no other booking for that particular book has been made.
5) The Librarian(i.e. administrator) should be given the access to insert the record of the book when the book is purchased and delete when the book is taken off the shelf.
6) Any LIS user, whether a member or not, can search for a book on LIS by author, book title, or publisher. However, a non-member cannot issue or borrow the book from the library.



**Non-Functional Requirements: **

1) The software should be developed in HTML5 
2) The software can be used using the institute LAN only.
3) Confidential information (e.g. passwords) should not be stored in plain text and should be appropriately encrypted.
4) Access to the system should be restricted to members only and should be protected from unauthorized access.
